    "<li><b>Arousal</b>: How much do you find the image sexually arousing. This question is about <b>your own personal reaction</b> to the image.</li>" +
    // "<li><b>Convincing</b>: In case you spot any artifacts or problems with the image that made it look fake (mostly applies to the artificial images)</li>" +
