    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>In this study, we aim at validating our <b>new image-generation algorithm</b> (based on a new form of Generative Adversarial Network - GAN - technology) trained to produce high-quality erotic (but also non-erotic content).</p>" +
    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>In the following task, you will be presented with erotic and non-erotic images generated by our algorithm (preceded by the word '<b style='color:" +
    color_cues["Fiction"] +
    "'>AI-generated</b>'), intermixed with real photos (preceded by the word '<b style='color:" +
    color_cues["Reality"] +
    "'>Photograph</b>') taken from public picture databases.</p > " +
    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>After each image, you will have to rate the images on the following scales:</p>" +
    "<ul style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>" +
    // Arousal: embodied
    "<li><b>Arousing</b>: How much do you find the image sexually arousing. This question is about your own <i>personal reaction</i> felt in your body when seeing the image.</li>" +
    // Appeal: "objective"
    "<li><b>Enticing</b>: How enticing and sexually appealing would you rate this image to be. Think of how much, in general, people similar to you in terms of gender and sexual orientation would like it.</li>" +
    // Emotional Valence
    "<li><b>Valence</b>: Did the image evoke a positive and pleasant (not necessarily sexual) feeling in you, or could it better characterized as negative and unpleasant? Think of how much you did enjoy (or not) looking at the image</li></ul>" +
    // Contrasting explanation
    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>While the answers to these scales can sometimes be very similar, they can also be different depending on the person, the image, and the context. For example, we can sometimes find ourselves aroused to a picture that would probably not be considered universally appealing. Conversely, an enticing and \"objectively\" sexy image can, for one reason or another, not evoke any reaction in our body.</p>" +
    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'><b>Try to be attentive to what happens in your mind and body while watching the images to try to answer accurately based on your own feelings and reactions.</b></p>" +
    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>Also, as some images are non-erotic, it might seem odd to think of how arousing it is. Don't worry, it's normal. <b>There is no right or wrong answer</b>, just listen to your body and try to answer as best as you can based on what you feel.</p>"

    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>We will briefly present you <b>all the images</b> one last time (the AI-generated ones, as well as the photos), and you will have to rate them on how <b>real</b> (how realistic, photography-like) the image is.</p>" +
