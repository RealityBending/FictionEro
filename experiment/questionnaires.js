// We adedd items specifically about CGI and artificial media (BAIT)

    "Artificial Intelligence might take control of people",
    // Neg10 (0.850, 0.848) - Modified: removed "I think"
    "Artificial Intelligence is dangerous",
    // Neg15 (1.014, 0.884) - Not used in FakeFace. Modified: replaced "I shiver with discomfort when I think about" by "I am worried about"
    "I am worried about future uses of Artificial Intelligence<br>",
    // Pos7 (0.820, 0.878)
    "I am interested in using artificially intelligent systems in my daily life",

    "Artificial Intelligence is exciting",
    // Pos14 (0.516, 0.346) - Low loadings
    // "There are many beneficial applications of Artificial Intelligence",

    // New items (Beliefs about Artificial Images Technology - BAIT) ---------------------------
    // Revised from Makowski et al. (Fake Face study)
    // Changes from FakeFace: remove "I think"
    "Current Artificial Intelligence algorithms can generate very realistic images",
    "Images of faces or people generated by Artificial Intelligence always contain errors and artifacts",
    "Videos generated by Artificial Intelligence have obvious problems that make them easy to spot as fake",
    "Current Artificial Intelligence algorithms can generate very realistic videos",
    "Computer-Generated Images (CGI) are capable of perfectly imitating reality",
    "Technology allows the creation of environments that seem just as real as reality", // New
