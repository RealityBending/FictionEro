**1. Introduction**
Imagine Alex. A month ago or so, Alex met Cal via an online dating app. They like each other, after some weeks of chatting they begin to "sext" (that is, to exchange intimate pictures). Alex likes Cal, and is aroused by the pictures. Alas, at some point, Cal confesses that the pictures are not photos: they are sophisticated AI-generated images.
Now, imagine Sam. Sam owns a small start-up which sells eco-sustainable swimswears on the web. To promote them, Sam is looking for male and female models posing with them. Of course, the sexier the better. The obvious option would be to hire actual models and have them posing with the products. However, an other option is available: hiring a skilled graphic designer that creates virtual models. They would be indistinguishable from real ones, if not for the watermark that is mandatory when using virtual models in Sam's country.
Until a few years ago, such scenario would be at best the plot of some sci-fi movie. Nowadays, they describe realistic real-life situations. Hence, it becomes pressing to be able to answer questions such as: _Would Alex still feel equally aroused by the images after having learnt they are not real?_ _And should Sam hire actual models or getting virtual ones in order to get the better ads?_ More generally, _does the belief that an image represents a real rather than a 'fake' person influences how sexually arousing it is found?_
