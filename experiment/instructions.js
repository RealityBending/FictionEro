    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>In this study, we aim at validating our <b>new image-generation algorithm</b> (based on a new form of Generative Adversarial Network - GAN - technology) trained to produce high-quality erotic (but also non-erotic content).</p>" +
    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>In the following task, you will be presented with erotic and non-erotic images generated by our algorithm (preceded by the word '<b style='color:" +
    color_cues["Fiction"] +
    "'>AI-generated</b>'), intermixed with real photos (preceded by the word '<b style='color:" +
    color_cues["Reality"] +
    "'>Picture</b>') taken from publicly available picture databases, adjusted to be of similar dimension and aspect as the artificially-generated images.</p > " +
    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>After each image, you will have to rate the images on the following scales:</p>" +
    "<ul style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>" +
    // Arousal: embodied
    "<li><b>Arousing</b>: How much do you find the image sexually arousing. This question is about your own <i>personal reaction</i> felt in your body when seeing the image.</li>" +
    // Appeal: "objective"
    "<li><b>Enticing</b>: How <i>in general</i> enticing and sexy would you rate this image to be. Think of how much, in general, people similar to you in terms of gender and sexual orientation would like it.</li></ul>" +
    // Emotional Valence
    // "<li><b>Emotional</b>: How much did the image evoke a positive and pleasurable (not necessarily sexual) feeling and emotion in you?</li></ul>" +
    // Contrasting explanation
    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>While the answer to these two scales can be very similar, in other times, we can find ourselves aroused to a picture that would probably be not considered universally appealing, and some other times an enticing image can, for one reason or other, not evoke any reaction in our body at a given moment.</p>" +
    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'><b>Try to be attentive to what happens in your mind and body while watching the images to try to answer accurately based on your own feelings and reactions.</b></p>" +
    "<p style='text-align: left; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;'>Also, as some images are non-erotic, it might seem odd to give think of how sexy or arousing it is. Don't worry, it's normal. <b>There is no right or wrong answer</b>, just listen to your body and try to answer as objectively as you can.</p>"
