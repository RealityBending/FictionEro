**Project Title:** Investigating the Effect of Perceived Realness on SUbjective Arousal Towards Erotic Images

**Project Description**

This study replicates and extends a previous experiment (ER/MHHE20/1), incorporating an eye-tracking task to explore gaze patterns.

- Consent form

At the beginning of the study, participants will be provided with detailed information about its purpose and goals. They will be explicitly informed about the nature of the erotic stimuli involved. Participants will be assured that their responses and participation will remain completely confidential and anonymous, with no identifying information, such as IP addresses, being collected. Data will only be saved at the conclusion of the study, allowing participants the opportunity to withdraw their participation up until that point. However, due to the anonymity of the data, withdrawal will not be possible once the data has been saved.

- Demographic Questions

In line with the study this research aims to extend, participants will answer a series of demographic questions to better understand the characteristics and representativeness of the sample. Notably, due to the nature of the study, information regarding gender and sexual orientation is crucial for appropriately assigning stimuli. No IP addresses or other identifying information will be collected, ensuring complete anonymity.

- Questionnaores 

Participants will complete the The consumption of pornography scale–general (COPS–G; Hatch et al., 2023) and Attitude towards artificial intelligence or AI (Makowski et al., 2023).

- Experimental Design 

Participants will provide informed consent and answer demographic questions.
To examine differences in gaze patterns between images labeled as "real" and "fake," participants will be asked for permission to collect eye gaze data during the first phase using their webcam. The information page will clearly state that the experiment does not record any actual images from the camera; it only collects estimated gaze coordinates on the screen via the WebGazer plugin to ensure full anonymity.
A cover story will explain that the study is testing a new AI image generation model. In phase 1, participants will view relevant erotic stimuli (selected based on their gender and sexual orientation), each preceded by a random label indicating whether the image is AI-Generated or a Photograph. Importantly, all images are from the Erotic subset of the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS-ERO; Wierzba et al., 2015) database and are real.
After each image, participants will be asked to rate the image on a 7-point Likert scale for sexual arousal (0 = not at all, 6 = very much), enticement (0 = not at all, 6 = very much), and the emotional valence (from 0 = unpleasant to 6 = pleasant).
Halfway through the phase, participants will be invited to take a break to relax their necks and eyes and instructed to press continue when ready to proceed.
Participants will then complete the second half of the stimuli and provide feedback on the attractiveness of the faces in the images, along with their beliefs about whether they can distinguish between AI-generated and real photos.
After this phase, participants will complete the relevant questionnaires.
In phase 2, participants will be informed that some images were intentionally mislabeled. They will be asked to categorize these images as either AI-Generated or a Photograph.
Participants will then view the same stimuli and rate each image on a 7-point Likert scale, from AI-Generated (-3) to Photograph (3).
Finally, participants will be given the opportunity to provide written feedback. The session will conclude with a debriefing paragraph explaining the true purpose of the study: investigating the effect of "beliefs" about fakeness on subjective sexual arousal. We will clarify that the AI model was not actually tested, all images were real, and apologize for the necessary deception.

- Debriefing

At the end of the study, participants will be debriefed, with a paragraph informing them of the true purpose of the study, on the effect of "beliefs" of
fakeness about erotic content. We clarify that we are not actually testing an AI model and that all the images are in fact real, and that
we apologize for the necessary deception. 

- Participants

Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). 
The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).
As we aim at recruiting a diverse sample, there are no exclusion criteria.

- Risks

A key ethical consideration in this study is the presentation of explicit images. However, given that we are recruiting participants via Prolific, we will set the minimum age for participation as 18. Apart from this, there are no significant risks associated with participation in this study.

**Section A**

No.
A2: Yes.
A10: An experimental manipulation is in place, involving the use of deception through a cover story that presents a different objective and misrepresents the nature of the stimuli (labeling them as AI-generated rather than real images). However, this deception will be clearly explained and debriefed at the end of the experiment. There is a potential risk that participants might feel uncomfortable, especially if they attempt the experiment in a public space. To mitigate this risk, participants will be warned at various stages about what to expect, and the consent form will suggest completing the experiment in a private space. Participants will also be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any time if they feel too uncomfortable.

**Section B**

- B.1: Study will attempt to recruit a minimum of 100 adult participants (based on typical samples of similar studies), with no exclusion criteria.
- B.2: Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).
- B.3: The survey will be completed online and involves two stages (see above).
- B.4: Online survey
- B.5: No
- B.6: Yes
- B.7: Yes
- B.8: Yes
- B.9: Yes
- B.10: Yes
- B.11: Yes
    B11a: Survey is anonymous so names and IPS, will not be collected. Raw data will be saved in a private OSF account accessible only to the researcher and the supervisor, and the data made available on Github will be anonymised beforehand.
- B.12: No
- B.13: Yes
- B.14: Yes
- B.15: Yes
- B.16: Yes
- B.17: Participants will be asked to click a box informing consent for the study.
- B.18: No
- B.19: No
- B.20: No
