THE RATIONALE
Imagine that Alex receives a love poem from a admirer of her/him/them. Alex loves the rhymes and feels flattered. 
However, they then find out it was not actually made by the admirer, but rather by Chat GPT. Would they still be flattered?
Now, turn to a more prosaic situation: imagine that Alex met Cal via a online dating app. They feel in touch and begin to sext, i.e. to exchange intimate pictures.
Alex likes Cal, and is aroused by the pictures. But then, one day, Cal confesses that the pictures are not photos, but rather sophisticated AI-generated images.
Would Alex still feel aroused by seeing them?
To investigate this question, we first need to acknowledge whether believing that someone is real (as opposite to fictional) changes our erotic arousal towards us.
Several published pappers attest that a same content is more emotionally invested when believed to be real than when believed to be fake [1-6].
More recently, it has been reported that presenting a face as AI-generated dampens its perceived trustworthiness [7].
In a previous pre-registered pilot study [8], some of us found that pictures of people in underwear are judged on average slightly sexier when they are believed to be real photos rather than AI-generated (either due to subjects' own judgments or to an experimental manipulation).
The present study aims at investigating the top-down influence of believing that a picture represent either an actually existing person or a fictional one on the sexual arousl it triggers in the onlooker.
It aims at replicating the results of [8] via a multi-country collaboration, employing validated stimuli from the EroNAPS database [9].
Moreover, it aims at investigating whether the effect found with self-report data is also visible in some simple phyisological measures such as skin conductance.

THE STUDY
Subjects will be shown 80 pictures from the EroNAPS. The stimuli include erotic photos of men and women, as well as non-erotic photos.
While all stimuli are real photos, subjects will be told that half of them (a random set) are AI-generated contents via a cue presented right before the stimulus itself.
For each stimulus, subjects are aksed how sexy it looks intersubjectively and how arousing they find it from their own perspective.
We aim at collecting 100 subejcts per country, total 400 subjects.
Subjects will be asked to verify their age, so that underage subjects will not be exposed to erotic material.
We will then investigate whether the st
