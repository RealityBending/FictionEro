// Questionnaires =================================================

/* Attitudes towards AI *==========================*/
// Beliefs about Artificial Images Technology (BAIT)
// History:
// - 1.0: BAIT-Original: Items specifically about CGI and artificial media originally in Makowski 2025 (FakeFace)
// - 2.0: BAIT-14: Validated in FictionEro (with new items + removal of "I think"), where it was mixed with the 6 most
//   loading items of the positive and negative attitutes dimensions from the General Attitudes towards
//   Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS; Schepman et al., 2020, 2022)
// - BAIT-14: Used in FakeNewsValidation
// - 2.1: BAIT-12: Used in FakeFace2.
//   - Removed 2 GAAIS items (GAAIS_Negative_9, GAAIS_Positive_7)
//   - Replaced "Artificial Intelligence" with "AI
//   - Change display (Analog scale -> Likert scale)
// - 2.1: BAIT-12: Used in FictionEro2
