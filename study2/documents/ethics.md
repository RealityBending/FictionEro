**Project Title:** Investigating the Effect of Perceived Realness on SUbjective Arousal Towards Erotic Images

**Project Description**

This study replicates and extends a previous experiment (ER/MHHE20/1) by incorporating an eye-tracking task to explore gaze patterns.

- Consent Form

Participants will receive detailed information about the study’s purpose, including the use of erotic stimuli. They will be assured of complete confidentiality, with no identifying information (e.g., IP addresses) collected. Data will be saved only at the study’s conclusion, allowing withdrawal until that point. However, due to anonymity, withdrawal will not be possible after data is saved.

- Demographic Questions

Participants will answer demographic questions to assess sample representativeness. Given the study's nature, gender and sexual orientation information will be collected to assign appropriate stimuli. No identifying data will be stored.

- Questionnaires

Participants will complete the Consumption of Pornography Scale–General (COPS–G; Hatch et al., 2023) and the Attitude Toward AI scale (Makowski et al., 2023).

- Experimental Design

After providing informed consent and demographic information, participants will be asked for permission to collect eye-tracking data using their webcam. The study will use the WebGazer plugin, which records gaze coordinates but not actual images, ensuring anonymity.

A cover story will state that the study evaluates an AI image-generation model. Participants will view erotic stimuli (selected based on their gender and sexual orientation), each labelled randomly as either "AI-Generated" or "Photograph." All images are, in fact, real and sourced from the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS-ERO; Wierzba et al., 2015).

After viewing each image, participants will rate it on 7-point Likert scales for sexual arousal (0–6), enticement (0–6), and emotional valence (0–6). A break will be offered midway to reduce fatigue. Participants will then rate the remaining images and complete the second half by providing feedback on the attractiveness of the faces and their ability to distinguish between AI-generated and real photos.

Participants will then complete the relevant questionnaires.

In phase 2, participants will be informed that some labels were incorrect and asked to classify images as "AI-Generated" or "Photograph." They will re-rate the images on a scale from -3 (AI-Generated) to 3 (Photograph). The session will conclude with a debriefing explaining that all images were real and that the AI model was not actually tested.

- Debriefing

Participants will be informed of the true purpose of the study—investigating how beliefs about "fakeness" affect subjective ratings. The deception regarding AI-generated images will be explained, and an apology will be provided.

- Participants

Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., social media) and platforms like SONA or Prolific. Separate analyses will account for differences in recruitment methods. There are no exclusion criteria, as we aim for a diverse sample.

- Risks

A key ethical consideration in this study is the presentation of explicit images. However, given that we are recruiting participants via recruitment platforms, we will set the minimum age for participation as 18. Additionally, the consent form asks participants to confirm they are over the age of 18. Apart from this, there are no significant risks associated with participation in this study.
**Section A**

No.
A2: Yes.
A10: An experimental manipulation is in place, involving the use of deception through a cover story that presents a different objective and misrepresents the nature of the stimuli (labelling them as AI-generated rather than real images). However, this deception will be clearly explained and debriefed at the end of the experiment. There is a potential risk that participants might feel uncomfortable, especially if they attempt the experiment in a public space. To mitigate this risk, participants will be warned at various stages about what to expect, and the consent form will suggest completing the experiment in a private space. Participants will also be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any time if they feel too uncomfortable.

**Section B**

- B.1: Study will attempt to recruit a minimum of 100 adult participants (based on typical samples of similar studies), with no exclusion criteria.
- B.2: Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).
- B.3: The survey will be completed online and involves two stages (see above).
- B.4: Online survey
- B.5: No
- B.6: Yes
- B.7: Yes
- B.8: N/A
- B.9: Yes
- B.10: Yes
- B.11: Yes
    B11a: Survey is anonymous so names and IPS, will not be collected. Raw data will be saved in a private OSF account accessible only to the researcher and the supervisor, and the data made available on Github will be anonymised beforehand.
- B.13: Yes
- B.14: N/A
- B.15: Yes
- B.16: Yes
- B.17: Participants will be asked to click a box informing consent for the study.
- B.18: No
- B.19: No
- B.20: No
- B.21: No
- B.22: No
